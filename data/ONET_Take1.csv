I don't understand what the word ""realistic"" has to do with the description of someone who enjoys working with their hands.

","I found this clip confusing because there was no explanation of a ""Job/Work Zone"".  At first I just saw word salad and didn't know where this was going, then after viewing the clip a few times I figured it out. 
The pacing on the ""experience"" part makes it hard to figure out what is being said.
I am not fond of using 2 hands to sign ""education"", but that could be just me.","Job/Work zone 2
Experience- some past work, training skills and knowledge are needed
Training- 2 or 3 months to a year shadowing an experienced employee
Education- HS diploma or GED
for example a firefighter, marketer, working in a bank","The expansion on the word ""experience"" makes sense until the last word, ""need"".  The description already said some past work training.....  so I don't understand why the word ""need"" was added at the end.  I watched it again and figured out where to put the comma.  The pacing didn't show a comma so I was thrown off.
I believe one of the examples was marketer, however, that sign can be market/store/sell. I read the interpreter's lips to determine the word. There isn't a better sign so I don't have a simple solution.","Job/Work Zone 3-  
Experience- Past work, training, skills, knowledge and experience needed
