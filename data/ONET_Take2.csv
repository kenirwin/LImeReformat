If you want to read the screen again or change your original answer, click on the ""Back"" button.   ","Well-translated in ASL. He added much more context that helped the clarify of the sentences as written in English. However, the only part that I was unsure about was how he mentioned the screen and clicking on Next. Maybe more clarity is needed to explain that to continue the test, click on the next button if that makes more sense? ","IP has sixty statements about careers of various people. Share how you feel about doing those specific careers. You will express your feelings through five possible answers: 5-Really Dislike, 4-Dislike, 3-Unsure, 2-Like, and 1-Really Like. ","The ASL context was very clear; however, I had a hard time figuring out if he was referring to sharing feelings about possibly doing that career or how you felt about the career in general. Maybe add a little context in that area. ","Read each sentence about various actions such as education, training, and salaries. Do not worry about those but rather focus on whether you like or dislike that specific career.  ","Very well translated. ","IP statements are not part of a test where answers are right or wrong. The purpose of IP is to explore your level of interest in various career possibilities. Do not hurry through the IP statements and take your time. Click on the ""Back"" button if you want to change your answer.   ","Even if I was able to infer that he was talking about interest level in career possibilities, I am not so sure that every viewer of the video would be able to make the same inference. Maybe add more context related to careers? ","1. I build Kitchen Cabinets.","Correct sequence of words in ASL. If I understood it correctly, the syntax was set up as a statement to imply that the viewer would be building Kitchen Cabinets as a career. Was that correct? ","5. I write plays.","I am not sure why the sign for ""book"" was included in this ASL translation because it implied that the person would be writing plays. Did you mean to say that the person would be publishing plays in the form of books? What was the purpose of the sign ""Book""? ","6. I use musical instruments such as drums, guitars, and pianos. ","Loved how this was translated in ASL because it mentioned musical instruments and was followed by examples for clarity. ","7. I teach people how to exercise. ","Maybe you should add a sign to indicate how exactly you would teach exercise...for example, in the capacity of a personal trainer? teaching fitness class? Maybe you can include examples like you did with the musical instruments in question 6? ","11. I develop spreadsheets using computer software. ","Well translated-the order of signs made it easier to understand. ","14. I take care of the fish at the Fish Hatchery.","Loved how you used the examples that made it very clear that you worked at the Fish Hatchery. ","15. I conduct various experiments with chemicals.","I loved how you used the tubes to help the viewer visualize the career choice of experimenting with chemicals.","16. I study planets. ","I am not sure if you meant for the word planets to be used or you were referring to astronomy. If you were referring to astronomy, you might want to spell that word out as it is not always easily identifiable through the sign of planets.  ","17. I create and write songs. ","Clear translation. Similar to what I said for question 16, if you meant to say musical composer, then you might want to spell that out. ","20. I will help people heal from injuries through rehab with various exercises and therapy. ","Too long and too much context. Seems like you were repeating some unnecessary words/signs. ","21. I operate a hair salon. ","Great translation--only thing I found vague was whether you meant to say operate or manage. The sign that you used implied that the person was operating the store. ","23. I am a IT computer technician working with software. ","If you meant to say IT and Computer Technician as two separate concepts then you might want to elaborate on both to help the viewer distinguish between both. However, I assume that you said Computer Technician as clarification for what IT meant? ","24. I use calculators.","Perfect and clear translation. ","25. I install different electrical parts.","Clear translation. ","26. I drive trucks and deliver packages to businesses and homes. ","Only thing unclear about this translation is what the person would be delivering as a truck driver? ","29. I produce special effects for movies. ","Perfect translation. I liked how you elaborated on the sentence with context in ASL that is not shown in the English translation. ","33. I founded my own business.","Clear translation and I am not sure if I correctly translated it as I thought about ""I own a business that I founded"" as a possible translation. ","36. I determine the salaries of my employees. ","Did you mean those people work for you and you determine their salaries? Is that the intended context? ","38. I fix and install locks. ","Clear translation. Simple and sweet. ","39. I create better ways to forecast the weather. ","You were referring to the context of forecasting the weather? I had to watch this video multiple times to reach that inference. Maybe want to rephrase this statement. ","40. I work in a biology lab. ","Clear translation. No changes needed. ","42. I tap dance with Jazz music in front of audiences.","Did you intend to say ""I am a professional Jazz tap dancer""? or something similar in context? ","44. I facilitate group therapy sessions. ","When you use the sign ""run"", are you referring to facilitate or conduct?","45. I work with clients on all types of lawsuits. ","I'm assuming you meant this statement in the context of a lawyer? If so, why not spell ""Lawyer""? ","46. I design and market my own fashion line. ","Seems like two career choices here...designing clothes...and marketing fashion...is that what you intended? ","49. I set up and operate machines that makes specific products. ","So interesting how you find different functions for the sign ""run""...in this statement, I am assuming you were referring to ""operate""? ","51. I created a new kind of sugar.","Totally unclear. I had no idea what you were referring to....especially the last sentence. Might want to redo this to add more clarity. ","52. I work in a lab that tests and identifies various diseases. ","I had to watch this video several times to make sure I understood it. Not sure if you wanted the viewer to watch the video over and over. If not, might want to rephrase this statement to make it more simple. ","53. I sing in a band. ","Perfect translation. No changes needed. ","Realistic means figuring out and solving problems. You like to work with plants, animals, wood, tools, and machines. Career possibilities are engineers, mechanics, police work and farmers. ","You were talking about three different things--the meaning of realistic, what people like to work with, and types of careers. I am not sure if I would lump all three together or create three different videos. ","Investigative refers to looking at facts and analyzing ideas and problems to reach solutions. Career possibilities include mathematics, science, and the medical field. ","Not sure if I understood the translation correctly--as I had to watch this multiple times to understand the basic essence of the translation. ","Artistic refers to creating art, music, and acting. Artistic people do not like rules and love flexibility. Career possibilities include actors, musical composers, and choreographing dances. ","Did you mean artists or choreographing dances? ","Social refers to those who enjoy helping, teaching, and advising people. Career possibilities include teaching, fitness coach, nursing, and counselor.  ","Best translation of words so far...I liked the clarity of this one. ","The word, enterprising, refers to those who like to organize projects, lead people, and make decisions. Career possibilities include law, owning a business, judicial, and politics.  ","Good translation but it highlighted a challenge of translating English to ASL without losing context. It looked like meant to sign lawyer, business owner, judge, and politican...however, how can those be worded as careers? That is why I gave the translation that I did. ","The word, conventional, refers to those who likes routine work, do not like to lead, and prefers attention to details. Career possibilities include secretarial work, banking, and financial analysis. ","Did you mean accounting or financial analysis? ","Strongly Like.","Perfect translation. ","Like","Excellent translation.","Unsure","Great elaboration. Perfect translation.","Dislike","Clear translation.","Strongly Dislike","Perfect translation. ","Job Zone 1 refers to jobs that do not require much work experience. One week to three months of training would be sufficient for the person to learn the job. High School diplomas or GED might be required. Jobs in Job Zone might include taxi driver, construction worker, and waitress.    ","Decent translation. Again, refers to jobs or careers? ","Jobs in Job Zone 2 requires some work experience. Two months up to a year of training might be required to learn the job. High School Diploma or GED is typically required. Jobs in Job Zone 2 might include forest fireman, working in a store, and working at a bank.    ","What kind of store and bank work? Did you mean in general? ","Jobs in Job Zone 3 requires more work experience. You might train and learn on the job for one to two years. You might need vocational school, previous work experience, and a college degree. Jobs in Job Zone 3 includes food service manager, electrician, law office secretary, and selling insurance.  ","I think this was the most clear translation of the job zones so far. ","Jobs in Job Zone 4 requires extensive experience. Training typically take many years to learn the job. Bachelors' Degrees or Masters' Degree will likely be required. Jobs in Job Zone 4 might include Accountant, Sales Manager, Teacher, and Chemist. ","Clear translation. The only thing...I was not sure if BA and BS was required or you meant to say Bachelors' Degree? ","Jobs in Job Zone 5 requires extensive experience and training. At least five years of experience is preferable. You will need training prior to starting the job that might be provided by the company. The job will require either a Masters' Degree, Ph.D, or a Law Degree. Jobs in Job Zone 5 include doctors, college professors, and librarians.   ","Might want to make the videos shorter...as this is a lot of information to absorb...however, the translation was excellent. ","Job Zones are selected in two ways: current and future,. Current refers to your present job experience, education, and training. Future refers to the experience, education, and training needed to do future jobs. Job Zones can be current or future ones. Do not worry about financial costs for the needed training and education but rather on learning about careers that might interest you.  ","Well translated but had to watch few times to make sure I had the English equivalent correct...however, this translation could have been back-translated to English in different ways. ","There are five types of schooling, training, and employment experience: 1. Not Much School/Training/Job Experience 2. Some School/Training/Job Experience 3. More School/Training/Job Experience 4. Lots of School/Training/Job Experience 5. Extensive School/Training/Job Experience. Select the Job Zone that matches the job that interests you. When finished, press the ""Next"" button.   ","Very confusing to translate...might want to redo this video. ","Choose a job based on the five job zones. Each Job Zone has a list of jobs and training/schooling/experiences required for each job. Job Zones and IP both help you find and learn more about jobs that interest you.  ","Had to watch this a few times...might want to make this more simpler for the viewer. ","You will see the list of IP jobs and IP job zones. Once you see both, click on ""next"".","It was confusing at how you used IP twice...is the job list and job zones both part of IP? ","IP careers are divided into six categories to match your preferences for a satisfying career: 1. Realistic 2. Investigative 3. Artistic 4. Social 5. Enterprising and 6. Conventional. Put your preferences in the order with the highest number being the best match for you. Take your time and look at various options under each category before pressing the ""next"" button. ","Don't use the five handshape when you have six categories...","You have learned about various job zones for current or future possibilities. Just select what you like. ","Less confusing than the last few videos...much more clarity ","Might want to break up this survey into multiple parts....it took me almost two hours to translate all of this....I cannot imagine how the viewer will feel...but this was vastly improved from the original one.
